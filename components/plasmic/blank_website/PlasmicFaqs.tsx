              "Frequently asked questions\nHow can I choose the right villa for me?\nThere are villas for all tastes and budgets. The first step is to think what you need. Who are you travelling with? Do you want to explore the island, or you need relaxation and isolation? Do you wish to be near the sea or inland? Will you rent a car? What kind of villa you prefer; modern or traditional?
